# roboto-regular.tff-with-fi-ligature-glyph-removed
On Android, the system font is Roboto. This font uses a ligature glyph for the combination of 'f' + 'i' characters. Frequently, the combination of the standalone 'f' + standalone 'i' will end up in conflict: the overhanging portion of the 'f' will collide with the dot of the 'i'. However, it is unnecessary and causes a unnatural pairing. Here is a replacement font with the 'fi' glyph removed. 

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU FUCK UP YOUR DEVICE. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

To install:

1.Root Android device.

2.Install SuperSU on the device.

3.Install a file manager app that supports Root file read/write on the device.

4.Copy Roboto-Regular.ttf to device.

5.Copy Roboto-Regular.ttf to /system/fonts/ on device using root on the file manager.

*Warning: The device may crash. This is because the main font has been changed. Please reboot manually via power button.*
Upon reboot, the device should have switched to the updated font with out 'fi' ligature. Worked for my Nexus 5X.
