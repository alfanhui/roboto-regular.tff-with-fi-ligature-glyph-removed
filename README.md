# roboto-regular.tff-with-fi-ligature-glyph-removed
On Android, the system font is Roboto. This font uses a ligature glyph for the combination of 'f' + 'i' characters. Frequently, the combination of the standalone 'f' + standalone 'i' will end up in conflict: the overhanging portion of the 'f' will collide with the dot of the 'i'. However, it is unnecessary and causes a unnatural pairing. Here is a replacement font with the 'fi' glyph removed.
